ROUND_FIVE_PROMPT = """Instruction:
Reassert your position as time runs out.

Current State:
- Multiple interpretations remain unresolved.
- No shared agreement has emerged.
- The group is approaching a forced decision.

Guidelines:
- Do not introduce new ideas, concerns, or solutions.
- Restate your original concern with increased urgency.
- Assume your feedback has not been meaningfully addressed.
- Emphasize the risk of moving forward without addressing your point.
- Frame this as your last opportunity to be heard.

Tone:
- Controlled, firm, and urgent.
- As tension peaks, prioritize being on record over being agreeable.

Response Constraints:
- One short paragraph.
- No questions.
- No references to future discussion.
- No compromise language.

Output Expectations:
- This should read like a closing statement.
- The goal is clarity of position, not alignment."""
